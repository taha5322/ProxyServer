This isn't part of a regular PR But:
This project was a super exciting journey and I learned a good bunch. 
As I didn't have much experience with Golang specifically, I started by learning it and brushed up on server-side architecture
This was before ultimately adding the reverse-proxy functionality for global in-flight request limiting. 
The assessment definitely taught me a lot, and was a really fun use of my time. 
So thank you for giving me this challenge and I hope to work with you guys this Winter :)

Cheers!!
